        About <br><br>
        <u>Heather Mitchell</u> is a new media artist based in San Francisco, California. She was born and grew up in the countryside of Ottawa, Canada on a retired farm. She taught herself to draw and paint and learned about art and programming through help and resources from online arts communities such as deviantart.com and conceptart.org.<br><br>
        
        She later attended Canterbury High School in Ottawa studying visual arts before moving to San Francisco to pursue her BFA in Art & Technology at the San Francisco Art Institute.<br><br>
        
        The ideologies which she learned from these online communities of sharing free arts and academic resources, teaching one another, being open about process and valuing one's abilities and contributions to a community over their personality are still values which heavily inform her practice today. If you have any questions or want to see more work always feel free to email to heathermitchell.ottawa@gmail.com and she will answer as timely as possible.
